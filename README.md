## Notes and writing
This contains some notes I have written up in TeX over the last little while. Each folder (with one exception) corresponds to one topic.



### The style file
To compile/edit the notes, you need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). However, my later notes rely on an (outdated) style file (`jack.sty`) found in the outlying folder that needs to be put in an appropriate directory. Windows users should follow [this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/1138/269697) and Linux/Unix users should follow [this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/10256/269697) to ensure it is put in the right place.
