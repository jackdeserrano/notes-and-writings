## Notes and writing
This contains some notes I have written up in TeX over the last little while. Each folder (with one exception) corresponds to one topic; therein will be the note in both `.tex` and `.pdf` format. 

To compile/edit the notes, of course, you'll need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). However, my later notes rely on a style file (`jack.sty`) fonud in the outlying folder that needs to be put in an appropriate place. Windows users should follow [this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/1138/269697) and Linux/Unix users should follow [this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/10256/269697) to ensure it is put in the right place. 

Please inform me about any errors in the notes or otherwise with an issue. One should note that my LaTeX practices were (and, to some extent, still are) dodgy. Be forewarned.

Thank you to Dr. Richard Borcherds, Khan Academy, and Dr. Benedict Gross for providing me with most of the content of these notes and, particularly, teaching me. I am working on some lengthy notes on algebraic geometry that I hope to complete by the fall of 2022.
